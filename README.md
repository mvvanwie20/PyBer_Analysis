# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a variety of isnights to data based on city type. Our first objective was to create a datafram containing total rides, drivers and fare and the averages of fare per ride and fare per driver. Our second objective was to create a visualization for the differences in fares between city types by week. 

## Results
We analysed the data in two approacheds. First we created a date frame showing the differences between total rides, drivers and fare and the averages of fare per ride and fare per driver. In this data frame, linked below, we could see that, with two exceptions, rural rides and the lowest amount of drivers, rides and total fares. However their averga fare per driver and average fare per ride were significantly higher than those for duburban or urban with the average fare per driver being over 3x higher than the urban rate. Urban came in second following the same pattern as rural with the average fare per drive being 2.5x higher that the urban rate. Urban had th highest amount of drivers, rides and total fares and the lowest rate per driver and rate per ride.

In the second part of the analysis we looked at the fares per week from January to May and found the same pattern. Urban was the greatest earner followed by suburban and lastly rural. Urbans highest peak was roughly $2,500 while suburbans was close to $1,500 and rurals about $500. The chart is linked below.

## Summary
Based on the results I would provide the following three suggestions:
- Provide driver incentives for number of drives or fare amount in rural areas to encourage drivers to stay in urban areas.
- Create a signing bonus for rural and urban drivers to boost the number of drivers which would lower to cost of rides and increase clinetele. However, the total amount of drivers should not be 1.5% higher than the total rides other wise the rate per driver would drop below the urban level.
- A signing bonus could also be created for the purpose of making the drivers wages more equal accross the board. By increasing the number of drivers in rural and suburban areas the average fare per driver would drop making it more equal to the ubran drivers. Again the total number of drivers should not increase above 1.5% the number of total rides otherwise it would drop below the urban level.
